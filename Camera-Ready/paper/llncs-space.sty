% Figure floating.
% Alter some LaTeX defaults for better treatment of the floating of
% figures. See p.105 of "TeX Unbound" for suggested values.  See
% pp. 199-200 of Lamport's "LaTeX" book for details.
% Remember to use [htp] or [htpb] for placement.

% General parameters, for all pages:
\renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.9}	% max fraction of floats at top
\renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.8}	% max fraction of floats at bottom

% Parameters for text pages (not float pages):
\setcounter{topnumber}{2}
\setcounter{bottomnumber}{2}
\setcounter{totalnumber}{4}             % 2 may work better
\renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.07}	% allow minimal text w. figs

% Parameters for float pages (not text pages):
\renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.7}	% require fuller float pages
